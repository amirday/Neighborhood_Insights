# Neighborhood Insights IL üè†

A mobile-first webapp empowering people in Israel to explore, compare, and filter neighborhoods based on quality of life factors including education, crime, services, prices, and commute times.

## üéØ Vision

Enable data-driven neighborhood decisions through comprehensive location intelligence, offering both address-level insights and reverse search capabilities to find areas matching specific criteria.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Discover (Reverse Search)
- Set filters: demographics, services proximity, crime, education, prices, commute time
- Interactive map heatmap with ranked neighborhood results
- Match scoring algorithm (0-100)
- Shareable deep links for results

### 2. Address Profile
- Enter any address ‚Üí comprehensive Neighborhood Score (0‚Äì100)
- Component breakdown: demographics, education, crime, services, transit, housing
- Interactive map: region boundaries, nearby POIs, isochrone overlays
- Optional Google Places integration for ratings/photos

### 3. Commute Filter
- Set work address with multiple transport modes (car, transit, bike, walking)
- Traffic-aware routing with configurable departure times
- Map highlights for reachable neighborhoods within time thresholds
- Save commute presets for combined filtering

### 4. Compare Neighborhoods
